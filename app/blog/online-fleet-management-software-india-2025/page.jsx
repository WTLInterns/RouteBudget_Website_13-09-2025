        In today's fast-paced transport industry, managing a fleet efficiently is no longer a task to be handled manually. As logistics, travel agencies, and cab operators grow, the need for an online fleet management software becomes crucial. It simplifies operations, enhances efficiency, and helps businesses save time and money.

      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Indian Transport Businesses Need It</h2>
      
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The transport industry in India is one of the largest in the world, and it faces unique challenges. From high fuel costs to regulatory changes and fluctuating demand, fleet owners need smart tools to stay competitive. Here's why fleet management software is essential for Indian transport businesses:
      </p>

      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-3">1. Cost Efficiency</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Fuel is one of the biggest expenses for fleet owners. Software like RouteBudget can help optimize routes, monitor fuel consumption, and identify inefficiencies that can lead to significant savings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-900 mb-3">2. Regulatory Compliance</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">India has a complex set of traffic rules and regulations, and fleet operators need to ensure compliance. A good fleet management software will help operators stay up-to-date with road tax payments, tolls, and FASTag compliance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

          <p class="text-gray-700">Indian roads can be hazardous, especially in rural or less-developed areas. Using GPS-based fleet management tools, operators can track vehicle locations in real-time and ensure drivers follow safe practices.</p>
