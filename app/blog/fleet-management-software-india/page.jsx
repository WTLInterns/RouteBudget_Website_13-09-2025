      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What is Fleet Management Software?</h2>
      
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Fleet management software is a digital platform that helps businesses manage, track, and optimize their fleet operations. It includes everything from vehicle tracking to fuel management, trip planning to expense reporting—all centralized in one dashboard.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">What Makes It Crucial in India?</h3>
      
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Indian transporters deal with unique challenges:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>Congested cities and traffic delays</li>
        <li>Inconsistent fuel prices</li>
        <li>Frequent toll booths and road taxes</li>
        <li>Irregular driver schedules</li>
        <li>Manual record-keeping and paperwork</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
        A well-designed fleet management software India solution must address these exact challenges—and RouteBudget does just that.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Indian Businesses Need Fleet Software Today</h2>
      
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The transportation ecosystem in India has evolved rapidly:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>Logistics demand has grown due to eCommerce</li>
        <li>Fuel prices fluctuate almost weekly</li>
        <li>Urban traffic has worsened</li>
        <li>Digital compliance (like FASTag and challans) is now mandatory</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Relying on paper logs and phone calls isn't practical anymore. Whether you're operating 10 cabs or managing 200 delivery vans, manual tracking leads to delays and inefficiencies, hidden expenses, and poor customer satisfaction.
      </p>
